Implementations of mathematical model for pair mediated disease transmission.

# Directory Contents:  

`model.py` - Contributed by Steven, creates plotting dashboard that displays model output for desired  
values of initial conditions and parameters.  

To execute, use command  
`python model.py`  

`Simplified Model.ipynb` - Contributed by Gilbert, initial Python implementation of simplified model,  
generates plot of model output for inputs specified in code.  

`CASB185Project.slx` - Contributed by Ruby, model implementation in Simulink, generates plot of model  
output for inputs specified in diagram.  

`CASB185ProjectPlot.m` - Contributed by Ruby, plots results obtained from Simulink model.
